# Stop_watch_myfirst_ES_Project
this is my first embedded system project without using any drivers so it was very very hard to build, design and implement a digital stopwatch with two operational modes: counting up and counting down. The project utilizes an ATmega32  microcontroller, six multiplexed seven-segment displays (com_anode), and multiple push  buttons for interaction.
